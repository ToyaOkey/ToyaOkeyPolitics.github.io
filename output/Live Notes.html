<a href="https://politico.com/news/2022/02/07/1960-electoral-college-certificates-false-trump-electors-00006186">Kennedy v Nixon </a>
-  Hawaii fake ballot situation 
- 3 false electors  </p>
<p>Nixon’s Hawaii electors met and cast their three votes in an official ceremony. But nearby, Kennedy’s three elector nominees gathered and signed their own certificates, delivering them to Washington as though Kennedy had won the state.  </p>
<p>so it seems that there were false electors however the recount reversed the actions of the signing of those documents </p>
