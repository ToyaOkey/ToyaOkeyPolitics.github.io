        <h2>Copied Summary</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodhead_Commission">Woodhead Commission</a> considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out).[102] With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasized serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the British tanks pass through the streets of Haifa, 1938. proposed Arab State.[102] The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to "political, administrative and financial difficulties".[10] </p>
