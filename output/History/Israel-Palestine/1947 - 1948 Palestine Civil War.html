        <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947%E2%80%931948_civil_war_in_Mandatory_Palestine </p>
<p>The initial phase of the <a href="1948 Palestine war.html">1948 Palestine war</a> and this broke out after the adoption of the <a href="Partition Plan.html">Partition Plan</a> mentioned in <a href="The United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, or Resolution (II).html">The United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, or Resolution (II)</a>. </p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>During the period of the <a href="../../Research/Foreign Affairs/British Mandate.html">British Mandate</a> Palestine had an uphill battle with the <a href="Zionism">Zionist</a> forces and the Palestinian nationalists where there was a period of the <a href="Arab Revolt.html">Arab Revolt</a> and the opposition the a immigration. </p>
<p>After <a href="World War II.html">World War II</a> and [The Holocaust] the Zionist movement gained more attention in recognition of a Jewish state as Zionist groups fought against the British administration. 
- Examples of Zionist attacks can be seen through the <a href="Haganah.html">Haganah</a>  </p>
<h2>Beginning</h2>
<p>A response from <a href="The United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, or Resolution (II).html">The United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, or Resolution (II)</a> from the Arab Higher Committee enacted a general strike lasting of three days and a <em>wind of violence</em> took hold on the country on both sides. 
- Kfar Sirkin killings - Jewish bus killing 
- Hadera killings - Jewish bus killing
- Shubaki family assassination 
- <a href="Irgun.html">Irgun</a> throwing bombs at mass crows of Arabs
    - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa_Oil_Refinery_massacre">Retaliation of 39 jewish people killed </a></p>
<p>The situation caused the <a href="United States Position on Israel - Palestine">United States</a> to withdraw their support for the <a href="Partition Plan.html">Partition Plan</a> and propose a trusteeship for Palestine supporting the Arab League to beleive that the palestinians could put an end to the <a href="Partition Plan.html">Partition Plan</a>. <em>Harry Truman was president during this time</em></p>
<p><strong>Fight and Military Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Zionist's had support of sympathizers in the United States and Stalin's support and recovering stockpiles in <a href="World War II.html">World War II</a>. </li>
<li>The Jewish Agency set aside foreign arms purchase at 28 million while the Arab Higher Committee total budge was 2,250,000. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Foreign Intervention</h2>
<p>Violence intensified and the British did not seek out to take control of the situation in the start. There was a decent amount of intervention with the regions of Syria and Jordan and some of the main cities. </p>
<h2>Morale of the fighters</h2>
<p>Arab Higher Committee was cofindent and in announcement to the Secretary General: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!attention] Announcement made to the Secretary-General on 6 February
 The Palestinian Arabs consider any attempt by Jewish people or by whatever power or group of power to establish a Jewish state in an Arab territory to be an act of aggression that will be resisted by force [...]<br>
   The prestige of the United Nations would be better served by abandoning this plan and by not imposing such an injustice [...]<br>
  The Palestinian Arabs make a grave declaration before the UN, before God and before history that they will never submit to any power that comes to Palestine to impose a partition. The only way to establish a partition is to get rid of them all: men, women, and children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The morale of Jewish leaders was not high <code>distress and despair arose clearly from the notes taken at the meetings of the Mapai party</code> and the attacks against Jewish <a href="&lt;a href=&quot;Israeli Settlements.html&quot;&gt;Israeli Settlements&lt;/a&gt;">settlements</a> and main roads worsened. Although, the <a href="Haganah.html">Haganah</a> remained superior in number and quality to the Arab forces. </p>
<h2>First Wave of <a href="../../Palestinian Refugees.html">Palestinian Refugees</a></h2>
<p>The morale of the Arab fighters was not shared among the civilians and Arabs in the mostly upper to middle class range fled in large numbers in steady exodus. </p>
