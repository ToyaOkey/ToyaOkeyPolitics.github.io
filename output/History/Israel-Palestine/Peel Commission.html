        <p>After a strike was called off the violence the <a href="Peel Commission.html">Peel Commission</a> was discussed. </p>

Herbert Samuel, had failed to create a unified political structure embracing both Palestinian Arabs and Palestinian Jews in constitutional government with joint political institutions</p>

<p>Failure facilitated internal institutional <a href="Partition Plan.html">Partition Plan</a> in which the Jewish Agency exercised a degree of autonomous control over the Jewish settlement. The commission concluded that 1,000 Arab rebels had been killed during the six month strike. </p>
<p>Noted two features of the revolt: 
1. support of all Arab officials in the political technical departments in the Palestine admin 
2. "interest and sympathy" of the neighboring Arab peoples</p>
<p>The main recommendation from Peel was the <a href="Partition Plan.html">Partition Plan</a> of Palestine into a small Jewish state incorporating the most productive land, a residual Mandatory area, and a larger Arab state linked to Transjordan. </p>
<ul>
<li>A second and more radical proposal was the transfer of 225,000 Palestinian Arabs from the proposed Jewish state to a future Arab state and Transjordan. it seems that <a href="Zionism">Zionist</a> leaders could have persuaded Peel to accept the notion of transfer. The Arab Higher Committee rejected the recommendations, and did the Jewish Revisionists. Ben-Gurion seemed to be delighted by the <a href="Peel Commission.html">Peel Commission</a>'s support. 
The British government initially accepted the Peel report in principle but they realized that implementation with a majority Palestinian Arab majority would cause the Arab world to go against Britain. The <a href="Woodhead Commission.html">Woodhead Commission</a> considered the plan differently that was discussed in the <a href="Peel Commission.html">Peel Commission</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Zionist Ben-Gurion accepted the plan as he believed it would be the first step to "possession of the land as a whole" </p>

<p>[!quote] Discussion of the <a href="Peel Commission.html">Peel Commission</a> to his son 
Of course the partition of the country gives me no pleasure. But the country that they [the Royal (Peel) Commission] are partitioning is not in our actual possession; it is in the possession of the Arabs and the English. What is in our actual possession is a small portion, less than what they [the Peel Commission] are 2 proposing for a Jewish state. If I were an Arab I would have been very indignant. But in this proposed partition we will get more than what we already have, though of course much less than we merit and desire. The question is: would we obtain more without partition? If things were to remain as they are [emphasis in original], would this satisfy our feelings? What we really want is not that the land remain whole and unified. What we want is that the whole and unified land be Jewish [emphasis original]. A unified Eretz Israeli would be no source of satisfaction for me-- if it were Arab

<p>[!quote] How he Felt with relationship with Arabs 
I do not dream of war nor do I like it. But I still believe, more than I did before the emergence of the possibility of a Jewish state, that once we are numerous and powerful in the country the Arabs will realize that it is better for them to become our allies. 4 They will derive benefits from our assistance if they, of their own free will, give us the opportunity to settle in all parts of the country. The Arabs have many countries that are under-populated, underdeveloped, and vulnerable, incapable with their own strength to stand up to their external enemies. Without France, Syria could not last for one day against an onslaught from Turkey. The same applies to Iraq and to the new [Palestinian] state [under the Peel plan]. All of these stand in need of the protection of France or Britain. This need for protection means subjugation and dependence on the other. <strong>But the Jews could be equal allies, real friends, not occupiers or tyrants over them.</strong></p>
<p>[!quote] Discussion of the Negev 
Let us assume that the Negev will not be allotted to the Jewish state. In such event, the Negev will remain barren because the Arabs have neither the competence nor the need to develop it or make it prosper. They already have an abundance of deserts but not of manpower, financial resources, or creative initiative. It is very probable that they will agree that we undertake the development of the Negev and make it prosper in return for our financial, military, organizational, and scientific assistance. It is also possible that they will not agree. People don’t always behave according to logic, common sense, or their own practical advantage. Just as you yourself are sometimes split conflicted between your mind and your emotions, it is possible that the Arabs will follow the dictates of sterile nationalist emotions and tell us: “We want neither your honey nor your sting. We’d rather that the Negev remain barren than that Jews should inhabit it.” If this occurs, we will have to talk to them in a different language—and we will have a different language—but such a language will not be ours without a state. This is so because we can no longer tolerate that vast territories capable of absorbing tens of thousands of Jews should remain vacant, and that Jews cannot return to their homeland because the Arabs prefer that the place [the Negev] remains neither ours nor theirs. We must expel Arabs and take their place. Up to now, all our aspirations have been based on an assumption – one that has been vindicated throughout our activities in the country – that there is enough room in the land for the Arabs and ourselves. But if we are compelled to use force – not in order to dispossess the Arabs of the Negev or Transjordan, but in order to guarantee our right to settle there – our force will enable us to do so</p>
