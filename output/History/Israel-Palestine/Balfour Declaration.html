<p>The <a href="Balfour Declaration.html">Balfour Declaration</a> was the document <em>image attached above</em> the leading document to establishing the state of Israel. Letter from Arthur Balfour of Great Britain to Walter Lionel Rothschild. <a href="https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/balfour-declaration/">2</a></p>
<p>Views the favor the establishment of Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and use what it can do to achieve this goal. The passage discusses "a national home for the Jewish people" and also discussed "civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine" and "the rights and political status of Jews in any other country" </p>
<p><strong>Why did the British Government Issue the Declaration</strong></p>
<p>Seems like other states such as pre <a href="World War II.html">World War II</a> Germany was interesting in also crafting such a document. </p>
<p>There is no clear or direct answer, supporting <a href="../../Research/Religion/Zionism.html">Zionism</a> was politically effective and seemed morally good </p>
<p>Additionally seemed to those practicing evangelical <a href="../../Research/Religion/Christianity.html">Christianity</a> returning the Jewish people to Palestine could bring about Christ's second coming. </p>
<p>On 13 June 1917, <a href="https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/histperson/118630709/">Chaim Weizmann (1874-1952)</a> wrote to Foreign Office Assistant Under-Secretary Sir <a href="https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/histperson/1190105624/">Ronald Graham (1870-1949)</a> that “it appears desirable from every point of view that the British Government should give expression to its sympathy and support of the Zionist claims on Palestine." The same day, Graham discusses the need to secure all political advantages for the connection with <a href="../../Research/Religion/Zionism.html">Zionism</a> </p>
<p>The Declaration was not the idea of the British alone and was seen that jewish leaders had long contemplated a "return to Israel" and reestablishment of a Jewish State envisioning a state defined by political dimensions and not based on religious or philanthropic concerns. </p>
<p><strong>Drafting the Declaration</strong></p>
<p>Authored by Sokolow, the statement forcefully reasserted the concepts of Palestine as the "National Home of the Jewish People" but did not mention the populations already within the region. The document called for internal autonomy and the substantial political power for the Jewish National Colonizing Corporation. </p>
<p>The wording was definitely hashed out and discussed 
- Edwin Montagu shared his sentiment speaking out against establishing a Zionist state and other people had a similar opinion; additionally advocated for final wording within the declaration</p>
<p>Was later understood that that nothing shall be done that can prejudice the civil/religious rights of existing non-Jewish people on the land</p>
<p>There still seemed to be issue with using the racial terms / criticizing the idea of a Jewish state </p>
