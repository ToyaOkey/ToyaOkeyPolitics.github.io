<p>proposal by the united nations as a proposal at the end of the <a href="../../Research/Foreign Affairs/British Mandate.html">British Mandate</a> adopted as Resolution 181. </p>
<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>Stemmed from the failing of the <a href="Peel Commission.html">Peel Commission</a> but also the promise of the <a href="Balfour Declaration.html">Balfour Declaration</a>.  </p>
<p>Discussed the delineation of boundaries between the Arab and Jewish state with the Arab state comprising old 11,592 sq km and the Jewish state containing 15,264 while Jerusalem and Bethlehem would become an international zone while additionally calling for an <a href="Economy">economic</a> union between the states. </p>
<p>The Jewish organizations collaborated with UNSCOP during the deliberations while Palestinian boycotted the movements since the Plan came off as pro <a href="Zionism">Zionist</a> since it allocated more land to the Jewish people despite there being twice as many Arabs. As a result the <a href="1947 - 1948 Palestine Civil War.html">1947 - 1948 Palestine Civil War</a> broke out and the plan was not implemented. In 1948, 85% of the Palestinians living in areas that became the state of Israel became <a href="../../Palestinian Refugees.html">Palestinian Refugees</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[!qoute] Ben Gurion expressed his apprehension, stating
the total population of the Jewish State at the time of its establishment will be about one million, including almost 40% non-Jews. Such a [population] composition does not provide a stable basis for a Jewish State. This [demographic] fact must be viewed in all its clarity and acuteness. With such a [population] composition, there cannot even be absolute certainty that control will remain in the hands of the Jewish majority... There can be no stable and strong Jewish state so long as it has a Jewish majority of only 60%.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine#cite_note-132">132</a></p>

<p><strong>Arabs</strong>
- rejected immediately after the voter for <a href="Partition Plan.html">Partition Plan</a> that they would not be bound by the decision </p>
