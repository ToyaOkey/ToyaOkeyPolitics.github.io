<p>armed uprising led by the Hashemite-led Arabs against the <a href="../Ottoman Empire.html">Ottoman Empire</a> rebelling against the Turks to accomplish an independent led Arab State </p>
<p>With backing from the British Military the Egyptian Expeditionary force fought and expelled the <a href="../Ottoman Empire.html">Ottoman Empire</a> from much of the Hejaz and Transjordan. 
Signing the <a href="Sykes-Picot Agreement.html">Sykes-Picot Agreement</a> with the French Republic the British reneged on their promise to support the Arab's establishment of a singular Arab state. Instead, the Arab-majority Ottoman territories of the Middle East were broken up into a number of League of Nations Mandates </p>
<p><em>I do see here that when the British wrote out the <a href="Balfour Declaration.html">Balfour Declaration</a> establishing a homeland to the Jewish people but renegotiation a deal with the Arab's and changing the promise of the Arab's establishment could come off to the Arab people</em></p>

<h2>Second - Palestine <a href="Arab Revolt.html">Arab Revolt</a></h2>
<p>1938 - 1939 
https://www.britannica.com/place/Palestine/The-Arab-Revolt 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine </p>
<h2>Build Up</h2>
<p>First sustained violence uprising of the Palestinian Arabs in more than a century. Several Arabs were mobilized to fight against the settlers and Israel claiming more territories. </p>
<p><em>It was mentioned in the <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Zionist_Bible/kb7oBAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1">Zionist Bible</a> where the effect would be to marginalize and displace the indigenous Arab majority</em> </p>
<p>Began with spontaneous acts of violence committed by the followers of <em>Sheik Izz al-Din al-Qassam</em> who was killed by the British in 1935. </p>
<p>April 1936, the murder of two Jewish people led to escalating violence. The Arab political forces formed an Arab Higher Committee which called for a general strike, nonpayment of taxes, end on migration from Jewish people, ban on land to sell jews and national independence. </p>
<h2>The Rise</h2>
<p>Arabs with the strike, and by volunteers from neighboring Arab countries, went to the hills and attacked Jewish settlements and British installations in the northern region. </p>
<p><strong>What causes the revolt?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reported under Royal Commission the revolt was caused by the desire for the Arab's to gain independence and fear of the Jewish national home. </li>
<li>Peak influx of European Jewish immigrants and plight of the rural <em>fellahin</em> who had to move to more urban areas. </li>
<li>described Arab causes as fear of growing Jewish economic power and opposition to mass immigration and fear of the British identification with <a href="../../Research/Religion/Zionism.html">Zionism</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>The Peel Commission declared the <a href="../../Research/Foreign Affairs/British Mandate.html">British Mandate</a> unworkable and that the conditions between the two groups were irreconcilable. The commission allotted an area that was immensely larger than the existing Jewish landholdings but recommending forcible transfer of the Arab population from the proposed Jewish state. The Zionism, still needed protection for their further development. From the Arab perspective it was horrifying the idea of dismembering the region and the suggestion of being forcibly transferred to Transjordan. </p>
<p><img src="../../../output/Images/Partition-plan-Peel-Commission-report-1937.gif" alt="Partition-plan-Peel-Commission-report-1937.gif"></p>
<p>By September 1937, the British were forced to declare martial law and the Arab Higher Committee was dissolved and many other organizations were arrested. </p>
<p>The second phase was a peasant led resistance provoked by the British repression in 1936, where British forces were targeted. The rebellion was brutally suppressed by the British and the Palestine Police Force. </p>
<h3><a href="../../Research/Economical/Economy.html">Economy</a></h3>
<p><a href="../../Research/Economical/Wealth and Poverty.html">Wealth and Poverty</a> contributed to the situations leading to the revolt. 
<a href="World War I.html">World War I</a> left Palestine deeply impoverished. The <a href="../Ottoman Empire.html">Ottoman Empire</a> and <a href="../../Research/Foreign Affairs/British Mandate.html">British Mandate</a> authorities levied high taxes on framing and agriculture produce and during the 1920 - 1930s there was a fall in prices and cheap imports with led to increasing indebtedness. The rents increased and there was a growing transfer of land from Arabs to Jewish settlement agencies <em>Jewish National Fund</em>. This increased the number of fellahin evicted while also removing the land. The Shaw Commission identified landless people and a lot of the country's peasant farmers made up two-thirds of the indigenous Arab population were pushed off the land in increasingly large numbers into urban environments often encountering several <a href="../../Research/Race/Systemic Racism/Socioeconomic.html">Socioeconomic</a> issues. </p>
<p>The <a href="../../Research/Foreign Affairs/British Mandate.html">British Mandate</a> tried to limit the transfer of land from Arabs to Jews however was easily skipped by willing buyers / sellers. The government set, the minumum wage, for Arab workers below that of Jewish workers which meant that those making capital investments in the Yishuv's infrastructure could take advantage of cheap Arab labor from the countryside. </p>

] By 1935 only 12,000 Arabs (5% of the workforce) worked in the Jewish sector, half of these in agriculture, whereas 32,000 worked for the Mandate authorities and 211,000 were either self-employed or worked for Arab employers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ongoing disruptian in the agrarian life who became mobile wage workers increasingly dealing with poverty and felt marginalize became willing participants in the rebellion. </p>
<h3>Political and Socio-cultural background</h3>
<p>Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam organized the Black Hand which was an anti-Zionist and anti-British militia. Three main jihadist groups that advocated for "armed struggle"
1. Green Hand (al-Kaff al-Kha ḍrā) 
2. Holy Struggle (al-Jihād alMuqaddas) 
3. Rebel Youth (al-Shabāb al-Thā'ir)</p>
<h3>Abroad  / International</h3>
<p>General strikes had been used by neighboring Arab countries to place political pressures on Western colonial powers. </p>
<h3>Conflict</h3>
<p>The news sparked Arab fear of a Jewish military takeover in Palestine, al-Qassam gave a speech in the port of Haifa denouncing the <a href="Balfour Declaration.html">Balfour Declaration</a>. Following the incident after a Jewish officer died the Palestinian police launched a massive manhunt and surrounded al-Qassam in a cave where later in the battle he was killed which generated outrage among Palestinian Arabs.  </p>
<p>Then uprising was triggered five months later by the Anabta shooting where the remnants of a Qassamite band stopped a convey on the road over revent of the death of al-Qassam and shot 3 Jewish passengers. There was a request for a solemn funeral but it was turned down by the district comissioner, who allowed al-Qassam a buriel later. The refusal sparked a demonstration by 30,000 jews in Tel Aviv who overcame the police and maltreated arab laborers and damaged property in Jaffa. The next day, Arab workers that were sleeping in a hut were killed in retaliation by members of the Haganah-Bet. </p>

Jews and Palestinians attacked each other in and around Tel Aviv. Palestinians in Jaffa rampaged through a Jewish residential area, resulting in several Jewish deaths.[70] After four days, by 19 April, the deteriorating situation erupted into a set of countrywide disturbances. An Arab general strike and revolt ensued that lasted until October 1936.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strike started where an Arab National Committee was formed where Nablus called for a general strike of all Arabs engaged in labor and transport and shopkeeping for the following day. Led to the formation of the Arab Higher Committee (<em>AHC</em>). </p>

<p>A month after the strike the leadership declared a general non-payment of taxes in opposition to Jewish immigration. </p>
<p>Huge target: <strong>Mosul–Haifa oil pipeline</strong> </p>
<p>Attacks consisted in various formats including civilian targets of Jewish settlements and, secluded Jewish neighborhoods. </p>
<p>Britain inundated Palestine with solders from the empire and took drastic measures such as house searches without warrant, night raids, preventive detention, caning, flogging, deportation, property confiscation, and torture. </p>
<p>Air Vice-Marshall Richard Peirse, commander of British forces in Palestine and Transjordan from 1933 to 1936:</p>

It was quickly evident that the only way to regain the initiative from the rebels was by initiating measures against the villagers from which the rebels and saboteurs came ... I therefore initiated, in co-operation with the Inspector-General of Police R. G. B. Spicer, village searches. Ostensibly, these searches were undertaken to find arms and wanted persons, actually the measures adopted by the Police on the lines of similar Turkish methods, were punitive and effective.[84]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>June 2, an attempt by rebels to derail a train bringing the Battalian from Egypt led to a response from the British in rounding up a large number of palestinian leaders and sent them to a detention camp. </p>
<p><em>Battle of Nur Shams</em> marked an escalation. </p>
<p>During July, Arab volunteers helped the rebels divide their formations into four fronts. A statement from the office in London declared the situation a d "direct challenge to the authority of the British Government in Palestine" and by the end of September 20K British troops in Palestine were deployed to "round up Arab bands."</p>
<p><a href="Peel Commission.html">Peel Commission</a> was a proposal however failed and developed into the <a href="Woodhead Commission.html">Woodhead Commission</a>. </p>
<p>With the failure of the commission the <a href="Arab Revolt.html">Arab Revolt</a> resumed marking the assassination of a district commissioner. Following this as in the Galilee Jewish people were advised to create a defense force, regulations were passed on the government to detain political deportees in any of the British Empire. <em>Haj Amin al-Husseini</em> was removed from leadership, the Arab Higher Committee was disbanded, and five Arab leaders were deported to Seychelles. All frontiers with Palestine were closed with telephone connections to neighboring countries being disbanded, higher press censorship and a <p style="color:blue">a special concentration camp was opened?</p><br>

Military law allowed swift prison sentences to be passed.[111] Thousands of Arabs were held in administrative detention, without trial, and without proper sanitation, in overcrowded prison camps.</p>

<p>The British organized collective fines, which became a heavy burden on the poor Palestinian villagers especially since the army confiscated livestock. Additionally, imposed curfews, demolished houses, detained some or all Arab men in distant detention camps. </p>
<p>'statutory' martial law was imposed and following the Arab capture of the Old City of Jerusalem, the army took control of Jerusalem and then <em>all of Palestine</em> and the main form of collective punishment by the British was destruction of property.

<em>Now I will never forget this incident ... We were at alMalikiyya, the other frontier base and word came through about 6 o'clock in the morning that one of our patrols had been blown up and Millie Law [the dead officer] had been killed. Now Gerald Whitfeld [Lieutenant-Colonel G.H.P. Whitfeld, the battalion commander] had told these mukhtars that if any of this sort of thing happened he would take punitive measures against the nearest village to the scene of the mine. Well the nearest village to the scene of the mine was a place called al-Bassa and our Company C were ordered to take part in punitive measures. And I will never forget arriving at al-Bassa and seeing the Rolls-Royce armoured cars of the 11th Hussars peppering Bassa with machine gun fire and this went on for about 20 minutes and then we went in and I remembered we had lighted braziers and we set the houses on fire and we burnt the village to the ground ... Monty had him [the battalion commander] up and he asked him all about it and Gerald Whitfeld explained to him. He said "Sir, I have warned the mukhtars in these villages that if this happened to any of my officers or men, I would take punitive measures against them and I did this and I would've lost control of the frontier if I hadn't." Monty said "All right but just go a wee bit easier in the future."[1]</em></p>

<p>Villagers were also searched by the British, Lieutenant-General Haining report of method for searching villages: </p>

A cordon round the area to be searched is first established either by troops or aircraft and the inhabitants are warned that anybody trying to break through the cordon is likely to be shot. As literally hundreds of villages have been searched, in some cases more than once, during the past six months this procedure is well-known and it can be safely assumed that cordonbreakers have good reasons for wishing to avoid the troops. A number of such cordonbreakers have been shot during searches and it is probable that such cases form the basis of the propaganda that Arab prisoners are shot in cold blood and reported as "killed while trying to escape". After the cordon is established the troops enter the village and all male inhabitants are collected for identification and interrogation.</p>

<ul>
<li>report was issued in response to the concern of the severity of military measures used by the British </li>
</ul>
<p>The British also enforced punitive measures onto cities with a night-curfew being imposed on most cities. It was additionally a common practice the British army use local Arabs as human-shields like <a href="../../Research/Foreign Affairs/Hamas.html">Hamas</a> forcing them to ride with military convoys to prevent mine attacks and sniping incidents as soldiers would tie hostages to the bonnets of lorries / put them on small flatbeds.

You know we were there we were the masters we were the bosses and whatever we did was right ... Well you know you don't want him any more. He's fulfilled his job.

<p>At the initial stage of revolt, from Haifa Naval Force two cruisers were used to carry out tasks ashore. The Royal Navy used naval mines from HMS Malaya to destroy Palestinian houses. </p>
<p><strong>Haifa Importance</strong></p>
<p>Britain had completed deep port in Haifa and was finished laying a pipeline from the Iraqi pipeline to Haifa for oil. A refinery for processing oil which was jointly owned by the British and Royal Dutch Shell. This enhanced the importance of Palestine and as the threat of the British control also seemed to be threatened as a rise of <a href="../../Research/Ideology/Fascism.html">Fascism</a> in Italy and the worsening situation the British were more likely to to make concessions in favor of Arab governments which over the recommendations of the <a href="Peel Commission.html">Peel Commission</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Role of the British Intelligence Services</strong></p>
<p>The deployment of British intelligence systems made it necessary as a counter strategy to restoration of British imperial control in Palestine. The rebellion brought together urban nations and <a href="../../Research/Race/Systemic Racism/Socioeconomic.html">Socioeconomic</a> conditions from the <a href="../../Research/Economical/Economy.html">Economy</a>. The revolt targeted the political and apparatus of the British colonial state which included the networks, and communication forces as the main aspects for the motivation of the revolt. As the general strike seemed to from and resurgence of pan-Aran nationalism forced the British response to the challenges led to a role of the Special Service Officers assigned to intelligence reporting with cats equipped with wireless transmitters.</p>
<p><strong>British and Jewish co-operation</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="Haganah.html">Haganah</a> <em>defense in Hebrew</em> supported British efforts to suppress the uprising and coopering with the formation of special defense forces. The Special Night Squads engaged in activity described by <em>Sir Hugh Foot</em> as 'extreme and cruel' involving pain, torture, and killing of Arabs. The British armed the forces and authorized Jewish policeman to equip guns, distributing weapons throughout the settlements. </p>
<p>June 1937, the British imposed the <a href="../../Research/Justice/Death Penalty.html">Death Penalty</a> for unauthorized possession of weapons, ammunition, and explosives but since many Jewish people had permission to carry weapons this act primarily targeted Palestinian Arabs.

A great deal of speculation later arose around the purported role of Germany and Italy in backing the revolt financially, based on early claims by Jewish operatives that both countries were fomenting the uprising by funneling cash and weapons to the insurgents.[l] German plans to ship arms to the rebels were never implemented due to distrust of the Saudi middlemen.[199] Italian attempts to furnish arms by the same venue were thwarted by British intelligence.[191] The British never found arms or munitions of German or Italian provenance. RAF intelligence dismissed these claims as either referring to 'comparatively small' sums or as purveyed to bring discredit on the Palestinians.
