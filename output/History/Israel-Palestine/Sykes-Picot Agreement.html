<blockquote>
<p>[!qoute] The 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement between Britain and France divided the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire into zones of occupation and protection. The dark blue zone was to be occupied by France, the dark red zone by Great Britain and the green zone by Russia. The light blue and red zones were intended as territory of an independent Arab state under respective French and British protection. The purple territory was to be cast under international control.</p>
