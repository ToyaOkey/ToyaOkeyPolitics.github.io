        <h2>Preferences</h2>
<p><em>how do we model peoples taste</em></p>
<h3>Preference Assumptions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Completeness - the assumption  that consumers can compare and rank all possible combinations of goods and services </li>
<li>Transitivity - if you prefer A to B and B to C, you prefer B to C</li>
<li>Non Satiation - <em>more if better than less</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Indifference  Curves - graphical maps of preferences 
- Four properties
    - consumers prefer higher indifference curves
    - Indifference curves are downward sloping 
        - violates non satiation if not met because the points would be on the same curve 
    - Indifference curves <strong>never</strong>* cross
        - crossing violates transitivity
    - There is only one indifference curve through every bundle

<h2>Utility</h2>
<p>Utility is not an ordinal concept. </p>
<h3>Utility Functions</h3>
<p><em>How can we mathematically represent people's wants</em>
<img alt="" src="Pasted%20image%2020250204042624.png">
Marginal Utility - derivative of the utility function with respect to one of the elements
- <em>thinking about the next unit</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Features diminishing margin utility <ul>
<li>the more of a good you have had the less satisfaction you derive from the next unit  </li>
<li><img alt="" src="Pasted%20image%2020250204042636.png"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slope of difference curve - marginal rate of substitution <ul>
<li>$MRS =  \frac{\nabla p}{\nabla c} = -\frac{MUc}{MUp}$</li>
<li>always diminishing </li>
<li><img alt="" src="Pasted%20image%2020250204043610.png"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explains why stores don't charge twice as much for twice the proportion <ul>
<li>The diminishing marginal utility shows that as you have more of something the consumer need for it diminishes meaner a consumer won't need to pay twice as much</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Utility Max</h2>
<ul>
<li>preferences </li>
<li>budget constraints </li>
</ul>
