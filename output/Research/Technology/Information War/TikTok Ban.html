<p>Noel Francisco - Attorney for Tiktok / ByteDance 
-  Three reasons why not banned 
    - tiktok inc is a us company in the us dance, burden on tiktok speech 
        - first admendment applies 
    - the act is content based, applies only to social media platforms, odd exceptions in the bill, single's out someone in the act 
    - the act can't satisfy any standard of scrutiny, the gov has no interest in preventing foreign propaganda 
        - note: you can have propaganda for foreign countries as foreign entity, you need to declare yourself with farha
- the first admendment leaves to the people about what info is right or what is wrong </p>
