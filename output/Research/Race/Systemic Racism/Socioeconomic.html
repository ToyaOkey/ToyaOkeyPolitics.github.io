<li><em>"Finally, researchers have focused minimal attention on last name selection with  regard to race. However, publicly available U.S. Census data show that only nine  last names among the most frequently occurring 1,000 are majority black, with  another 15 last names registering at 40 percent to 50 percent black (U.S. Census  Bureau 2012). Earlier correspondence audits often mixed “black” first names with both predominantly black last names and predominantly white last names within a study (Hanson and Hawley 2011; Milkman, Akinola, and Chugh 2012), whereas more recent studies often match first and last names by race (Gaddis 2016; Hanson et al. 2016). The effect of this selection on outcomes in correspondence audits is not only unknown but heretofore unquestioned"</em>  </li>

<li><em>But those gains haven’t led to any narrowing of the wealth gap between the races. </em><em>In fact, after adjusting for inflation, the median net worth for black households in 2011 ($6,446) was lower than it was in 1984 ($7,150), while white households’ net worth was almost 11% higher.</em><em> And as NYU researcher David Low noted in a recent working paper, high-earning married black households have, on average, less wealth than low-earning married white households“</em>  </li>

The inspector, wielding a hand-held device that can detect lead through multiple layers of paint, found the dangerous heavy metal in both homes. The Health Department ordered the Housing Authority to fix the problems."</em>  </li>
