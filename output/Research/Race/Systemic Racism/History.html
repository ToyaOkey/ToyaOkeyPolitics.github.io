        <h2>Black Codes and Jim Crow</h2>
<ul>
<li>The supreme court had ruled in <a href="../../../Branches/Supreme Court/Cases/Plessy v. Ferguson.html">Plessy v. Ferguson</a> that segregation was constitutional </li>
<li>zoning laws prohibited black families from moving into white dominated areas </li>
<li>only a small portion of houses were build for black families </li>
</ul>
<h2>Red lining</h2>
<ul>
<li>the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Home Owners' Loan Corporation conspired to create maps with marked areas considered bad risks for mortgages in a practice known as <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/definition-of-redlining-1798618">â€œred-lining".</a><ul>
<li>Time period 1930s - 1970s </li>

<p>[!info] House Discrimination 
"We find that lenders charge Latinx/African-American borrowers 7.9 and<br>
3.6 basis points more for purchase and refinance mortgages respectively, costing them $765M in aggregate per year in extra interest. FinTech algorithms also discriminate, but 40% less than faceto-face lenders"  </p>
<p>[!info] Disparities Between Races 
"Face-to-face lenders reject Latinx and African-American applications approximately 6% more often than they reject similarly situated non-minority applicants for both purchase and refinance loans. In aggregate, our findings suggest that from 2009 to 2015, lenders rejected 0.74 to 1.3 million Latinx and African-American applications that would have been accepted except for discrimination."  </p>
<p>[!info] Effects on Housing Applications
"Early studies looking at the raw HMDA data found that minority loan applicants were rejected much more often than white applicants even with higher incomes, however, these papers but did not control for variables not collected by HMDA, such as credit history. In a widely cited paper, Munnell, Browne, McEneaney, and Tootel (1996) combined HMDA data on loan applications in Boston in 1990 with<br>
additional borrower data collected via survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and found that after controlling for borrower characteristics, especially credit history and loan-to-value ratio, white applicants with the same property and personal characteristics as minorities would have experienced a rejection rate of 20% compared with the minority rate of 28%"  </p>
<p>[!info] Interest Rates and Points 
"Cheng, Lin and Liu (2015) use data from the Survey of Consumer Finances to compare mortgage interest rates for minority and non-minority borrowers. They find that black borrowers on average pay about 29 basis points more than comparable white borrowers, with the difference larger for young borrowers with low education, subprime borrowers, and women."  </p>
