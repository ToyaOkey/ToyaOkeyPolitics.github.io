<h2>Lead Poisoning Effects</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>[!Quote] Led Poisoning Has a Higher Effect on African-Americans
"Despite the federal mandate to affirmatively further fair housing, the majority of federally assisted housing is clustered in low-income, segregated areas at high risk of lead poisoning. Decades of government-sanctioned discriminatory practices have burdened communities of color with increased poverty, segregation, substandard housing, and environmental hazards. Today, the black population has the highest rate of poverty at 24.1 percent compared to the white population at 9.1 percent. One-third of black children live below the poverty line and in high-poverty areas, nine times the rate of white children in poverty. <strong>The risk of lead poisoning falls disproportionately on minority children, as well, with black children nearly three times more likely than white children to have elevated blood-lead levels</strong>. One study found “extraordinarily high rates of lead toxicity” in black and Hispanic neighborhoods with <strong>“prevalence rates topping 90% of the child population.”</strong> The authors concluded, “Lead toxicity is a source of ecological inequity by race and a pathway through which racial inequality literally gets into the body.”  </p>
<p>[!quote] Some Houses Still Contain Led Poisoning 
"In 2016, HUD identified 57,000 federally assisted housing units with <strong>lead hazards and 450,000 federally assisted housing units occupied by a child and built before 1978</strong>, the year lead-based paint was banned for residential purposes. HUD estimates that more than 62,000 public housing units are in need of lead abatement"  </p>
<p>[!quote] Result From Chicago and Neuro Damage 
"Despite these recommendations, HUD does not require pre-rental lead hazard risk assessments in the Housing Choice Voucher program or project-based Section 8 housing for units receiving less than $5,000 in assistance. For Lanice Walker and Tolanda McMullen, Housing Choice Voucher program participants in Chicago, the lack of primary prevention resulted in lead poisoning and numerous disabilities for their once healthy children. <strong>Their pre-1978 units did not undergo a lead hazard risk assessment and still passed the housing authority’s “housing quality standards” inspection.</strong> Both mothers believed the “pass” result meant the home was safe for their children. They are not alone. <strong>Between 2010 and 2016, more than $5.6 million in federal funds were used to subsidize Housing Choice Voucher program units with known and uncontrolled lead hazards in Chicago alone</strong>. As a result, children in <strong>187 homes were lead poisoned at levels above the CDC reference value, suffering permanent neurological damage</strong>. “My baby had been healthy,” Ms. McMullen told the Chicago Tribune, then “one day it seemed like the light in his eyes had just gone out.”  </p>
<p>[!quote] New York Section 8 Failed Inspection 
"Lead hazard risk assessments and abatement are required in public housing and project-based <strong>Section 8 housing</strong> for units receiving more than $5,000 in assistance. However, enforcement of these rules is hampered by a lack of coordination between agencies. Federal investigators recently determined that the <strong>New York City Housing Authority falsely certified that it had inspected thousands of apartments for lead paint, exposing children in more than 4,700 federally assisted housing units to toxic lead paint</strong>. In East Chicago, Indiana, Stephanie King recently vacated the West Calumet Housing Complex due to hazardous levels of arsenic and lead surpassing 228 times the maximum permitted levels. Like all of the complex’s 1,100 residents, Ms. King was informed of the health hazards in her environment in August 2016, eight years after the area was designated a Superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Generations of families and thousands of people have suffered prolonged exposure to neurotoxins and carcinogens since the complex was first erected in 1966 on the former site of the US Smelter and Lead (USS Lead) Refinery and near other smaller smelting plants. West Calumet is not an isolated incident. Approximately 70 percent of the nation’s federally assisted housing is located near one of the country’s 1,400 Superfund sites."  </p>
<p>[!quote] Mike Pence Discriminating Against Majority Black Population in West Calumet 
"As recently as 2016, former Indiana Governor (and current vice president) <strong>Mike Pence refused to provide disaster relief to move families out of the toxic West Calumet Housing Complex and surrounding areas, where the population is 99 percent black</strong>. He did not hesitate to provide assistance to Greentown, Indiana, when the lead content of its water was slightly elevated. Greentown’s population is 97 percent white. As Nicholas Kristof noted in an op-ed in the New York Times, “The continuing poisoning of half a million American children is tolerated partly because the victims often are low-income children of color.”"  </p>
<p>[!quote] Response / After Effects
"While the United States has made some progress since the scourge of lead poisoning was first acknowledged, HUD and most cities across the country still require that a child must be lead poisoned before lead hazards are removed from certain federally assisted housing and nearly all private housing"</p>
<p>"the “net benefit of lead hazard control ranges from $181 to $269 billion, resulting in a return of $17–$221 for each dollar invested in lead hazard control.”  </p>

<h2>Stop and Frisk</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>[!Quote]
 "The citywide aggregate figures showed large differences between racial groups in the rates of frisk, search, use of force, and arrest. Accounting for important factors, such as time, place, and reason for the stop, indicates that a large portion of that gap is actually due to differences in these factors and not necessarily race.<br>
After adjusting for stop circumstances, we found differences in the rates of some outcomes in some boroughs. On average, nonwhites experience more intrusive stops than do similarly situated white suspects. The Staten Island borough stands out particularly, with several large racial gaps in the frisk, search, and use-of-force rates.<br>
The aggregate figures on contraband recovery rates were, perhaps, the most startling,<br>
given that recovery rates for white suspects were nearly twice those for black suspects. However, after accounting for several important factors, the recovery rate for white suspects is 12 percent greater than that for black suspects (6.4 percent versus 5.7 percent). When considering only recovery rates of weapons, we find no differences at all by race. For every 1,000 frisks of black suspects, officers recovered seven weapons; for every 1,000 frisks of similarly situated white suspects, they recovered eight weapons, a difference that is not statistically significant."</p>
