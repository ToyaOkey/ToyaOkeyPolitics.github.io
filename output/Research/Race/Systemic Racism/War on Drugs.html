        <h2>War on Drugs</h2>
<p>The <a href="War on Drugs.html">War on Drugs</a> is the global campaign led by the United States of America to reduce illegal drug trade globally. </p>
<p>It is evident that the war on drugs has lead to a disproportioned impact on the African-American community. <strong>Despite <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/2022-12/2021NSDUHFFRHighlightsRE123022.pdf">drug use being a similar rate</a> between African-American's and White people black people are 4X more likely to be arrested</strong>.

<p>[!Quote] 
In 2021, American Indian or Alaska Native (36.1%) or Multiracial people (34.6%) were more likely to have used illicit drugs in the past year compared with Black or African American (24.3%), White (22.5%), Hispanic or Latino (19.4%), or Asian people (11.1%). Asian people were less likely to have used illicit drugs in the past year compared with people in most other racial or ethnic group</p>
