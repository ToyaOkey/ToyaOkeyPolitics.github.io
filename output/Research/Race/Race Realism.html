 - MAOA - H - high functioning 
 - MAOA - L <em>low functioning</em> can lead to more aggression <em>found more often in men</em>
 - it seems that having the gene alone doesn't cause the violence, has to be caused by external factors
 - Additionally, when testing with Dutch males who had proper education they seemed to have limited outbursts 
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11126-013-9287-x">The 2-repeat allele of the MAOA gene confers an increased risk for shooting and stabbing behaviors</a>
- it is true that the MAOAR shows more presence in violent crime, however with research it seems it only had effects in the presence of environmental liabilities

- 5.5% of African Americans carry the gene and 1% Caucasians - the study mainly only looked at African Americans 
- but only among males who were exposed to environmental liabilities, such as childhood maltreatment, abuse, and negligence<br>
- another study, also analyzing the Add Health data, Beaver et al. [2] reported a link between the 2-repeat allele and the odds of being arrested, the odds of being incarcerated, and a lifetime measure of antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, neither the Beaver et al. study nor the Guo et al. [9] study specifically examined the most serious and violent types of criminal behaviors, but rather grouped together a wide range of antisocial behaviors, some of which are violent and some of which are non-violent. Given that research has revealed that violent and non-violent criminal behaviors might have different etiologies [4], the next important step in the 2-repeat research is to examine this alleleâ€™s association with some of the most violent types of behaviors. Against this backdrop, the current study examines the effect of the 2-repeat allele on two highly violent behaviors: shooting and stabbing someone. The findings will help to reveal whether the 2-repeat allele has effects on violent criminal behaviors rather than antisocial behavior broadly defined.<br>
- These findings stand in stark contrast to much of the extant MAOA research which has <strong>revealed that MAOA only has effects on antisocial behaviors in the presence of environmental liabilities</strong> </p>
