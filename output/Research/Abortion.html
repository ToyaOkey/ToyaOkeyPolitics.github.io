<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>A surgical abortion or a medical abortion, as those terms are defined in this section, respectively </p>
<h2>Facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>abortion stops being affective after 165+ pounds</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Most third trimester abortions which are rate &lt;2% are due to serious reasons such as life <a href="">threatening information</a> </li>
</ul>
<h2>Stance</h2>
<p>As <a href="../Images/Abortion.html">Abortion</a> is a non-divisive issue for the nation, I remain with the position that abortion should be legal at least the first trimesters. </p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>The important concept of life where we evaluate our experience, processing and general life comes from <strong>consciousness</strong> which does not develop until roughly at least 20 weeks. There is generally no harm in removing a fetus that has no experience. Almost like pulling the plug on someone who is <em>medically dead</em> although some people will fight over this.  </p>
<p>What constitutes as <a href="Philosophy/Personhood.html">Personhood</a>? </p>
<h3>"My Body My Choice"</h3>
<p>Not a fan of this argument, as I do not believe another experience within the body gives humans the right to terminate them. </p>
<ul>
<li>In the example of conjoined twins where two people are literally attached, would one twin have the right to kill the other? <ul>
<li>Let's say you believe <em>oh well one is not a sane experience</em> you are either conceding<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That it's not the bodily autonomy that matters but the experience </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>No one should be allowed to terminate another experience solely for relying on the same body</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What if a baby depended on you to breastfeed them? <em>theoretical</em></li>
<li>Someone alcohol poisons you and destroys your kidney, are they compelled to give you a kidney? </li>
<li>Should a pregnant women be able to personally abort her fetus with no repercussions in this case? </li>
</ul>
<h3>Viability</h3>
<p>Ehh this one is interesting, this would be hard - viability has several different pinpoints and this <em>could</em> almost be a eugenics stance </p>
