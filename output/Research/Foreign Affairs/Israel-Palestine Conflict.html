<p>media suppression<br>
"<br>
The Israel Defence Forces often violate the rights of Palestinian journalists, especially when they are covering demonstrations in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. Two Palestinian journalists were killed by IDF snipers and dozens were wounded while covering the “March of Return” protests in the Gaza Strip in 2018. Under Israel’s system of administrative detention, Palestinian journalists can be held indefinitely without formal charge and without notification of a lawyer, on the grounds that they are inciting violence or cooperating with terrorist organizations. The IDF has harassed or closed many Palestinian media outlets in recent years for allegedly inciting violence."  </p>

"Israel controls its coastline and all the entry and exit crossings into Israel. There is another crossing point in Egypt. There is no working airport. Because access is so restricted, not many goods get into or out of Gaza. Food is allowed in, but aid agencies say families are not eating as much meat or fresh vegetables and fruit as they used to. There are often power cuts."  </p>
<p>"During the 1948 and 1967 wars hundreds of thousands of Palestinians left, or were forced out of, their homes and moved to neighbouring countries to become refugees.  </p>
<p>More than 4.6 million Palestinians are refugees and their descendants, many living in camps in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. They get help from the United Nations."  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/20436092">https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/20436092</a>  </p>
<p>"In May 2018, tensions erupted once again when the U.S. Embassy relocated to Jerusalem. Perceiving this as signal of American support for Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, Palestinians responded with protests at the Gaza-Israel border, which were met with Israeli force resulting in the deaths of dozens of protesters. Here is how conflict over ownership of the region has played out over the last 70 years."  </p>
<p>"As of 2018, most of the Palestinian inhabitants are the original 1948 war refugees and their descendants, many of them still living in refugee camps."  </p>

<p>Goal of Palestinians 
From the war that caused creation of Israel and displacement of Palestinians, Palestinians are seeking out an independent state of their own in at least one of the historic sights however the isreali defense + occupation makes the goal hard to attain </p>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<ul>
<li>former Palestine land was a part of the Ottoman empire consisted of several groups mainly Arab Muslims however other groups existed </li>
<li>Zionist movement called for haven for Jewish people of the World where they would have self-determination in the land of Israel </li>
<li>Seems that <a href="../../History/Israel-Palestine/Balfour Declaration.html">Balfour Declaration</a> was originally accepted provided Palestine being included as an Area of Arab  independence <ul>
<li>seemed to be Jordan </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>More Progress</h3>
<ul>
<li>As more Jewish people began to settle into the land due to the rising Anti-Semitism in Europe Palestinians started to show resistance to the immigration mainly due to new immigrants refusing to sell or lease land to Palestinians or hire them </li>
<li>Retaliation started to show form in Palestinian attacks as riots against the new immigrants </li>
<li><a href="Two State Solution.html">Two State Solution</a> was proposed and divided into two regions seemed that the Zionist congress was convinced to approve however this movement was rejected by the British (not sure on this one) but also by the Palestinians, rejection led to establishment of <a href="../../History/Israel-Palestine/Woodhead Commission.html">Woodhead Commission</a> </li>
<li>May 1939, one-state solution was proposed and mandated by British, which significantly reduced the number of Jewish people entering, placing a quota on the immigration additionally placed restrictions on the rights of jews to buy land from Arabs <ul>
<li>although this was during the time period of ww2 and the holocaust which causes some more tensions as there were waves of Jewish people in illegal immigration to the Palestinian territory </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
