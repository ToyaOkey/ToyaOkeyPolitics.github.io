<h2>Background Information</h2>
<p>Emerged from the <a href="../../History/Ottoman Empire.html">Ottoman Empire</a> collapsing after <a href="World War I.html">World War I</a> allowing the british and French to gain control over the region </p>
<p>Led the British Government to recognize the independence of different countries after the war in exchange for <em>Husayn ibn Aly</em> which led to the <a href="../../History/Israel-Palestine/Arab Revolt.html">Arab Revolt</a> against the <a href="../../History/Ottoman Empire.html">Ottoman Empire</a> and the <a href="../../History/Israel-Palestine/Sykes-Picot Agreement.html">Sykes-Picot Agreement</a> divided the Middle East into several different British and French <em>spheres of influence</em> and the <a href="../../History/Israel-Palestine/Balfour Declaration.html">Balfour Declaration</a> which the British Government committed itself to a national home for the Jewish people </p>
<p>Seems that the idea was Britain was given a "dual mandate" system on behalf of the current inhabitants of Palestine while also giving Jewish people a settlement for their haven. </p>
<h2>Mandate Period</h2>
<p>Over the mandate, two systems were developed under the framework, one under Arab control and the other under Jewish control. Each society has it's own <a href="../Race/Systemic Racism/Socioeconomic.html">Socioeconomic</a> framework and became isolated from each other </p>
<p><em>More tensions started to arise as the groups became isolated from another</em></p>
<p><a href="../Religion/Zionism.html">Zionism</a> movements operated under the axes of land acquisition and immigration which including buying land from Arab's.  Palestine population grew from 700K - 1.8 million while the Jewish population grew under more <a href="../Immigration/General Immigration.html">General Immigration</a> tenfold </p>
<h3>Jewish-Arab Conflict</h3>
<p>During the 1920s - 1930s, violent actions between Jewish people and Arabs took place, known as the Wailing Wall Riots, which is considered a turning point. </p>
<p>Arabs did not distinguish between the Jewish people of Arab origin and the Jewish people of eastern European origin which viewed that all as a homogenous group with all the same interests, led to a conclusion that a Jewish state is needed. </p>
<p>Response from British: Shaw Commission which sought out a review of Jewish immigration and land purchasing. </p>
<p>More conflicts aroused and led to an <a href="../../History/Israel-Palestine/Arab Revolt.html">Arab Revolt</a> which was triggered by and economic crisis and mass immigration of Jewish people which increased after <a href="Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a> took power in Germany during <a href="World War II.html">World War II</a>. Royal Commission was established which concluded that Palestine had two different societies making it necessarily to <a href="../../History/Israel-Palestine/Partition Plan.html">Partition Plan</a>. Arab Higher Committee rejected the recommendations and led to another revolt. Britain's response was marked by violent force and the Arab Higher Committee was dissolved and declared and illegal body. </p>
<p>In response to the revolt, the British Government issue the <a href="../../History/Israel-Palestine/White Paper.html">White Paper</a> which weakened the Arab society and after <a href="World War II.html">World War II</a> failed to recover until <a href="../../History/Israel-Palestine/1948 Palestine war.html">1948 Palestine war</a></p>
<p>The negative opinions of the situation within Palestine made the mandate unpopular within Britain and led the termination and involvement of the united nations. </p>
<p>After the UN General Assembly, it was announced the mandate ended effective <strong>May 15 1948</strong> and on <strong>May 14 1948</strong> <em>at midnight</em> the state of Israel declared independence </p>
