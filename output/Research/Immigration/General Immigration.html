<p>"Rates of immigrant imprisonment are complicated further by the fact, noted at the outset of this chapter, that immigrants are younger and more often male than are citizens. Because young men are at much greater risk than others for involvement in crime and imprisonment, the base used in calculating an imprisonment rate for immigrants is probably most usefully adjusted for sex and age. In the last column of Table 9-1 we have calculated imprisonment ratios using denominators for the compared rates that estimate the male populations of immigrants between 15 and 34 years of age from the various countries. The resulting ratios reveal greater similarity between immigrants and citizens than was previously apparent."  </p>

<p>Most deportations were not because of illegal immigrants.  </p>
<p>"Immigrants convicted of a crime made up the minority of deportations in 2017, the most recent year for which statistics by criminal status are available. Of the 295,000 immigrants deported in 2017, some 41% had criminal convictions and 59% were not convicted of a crime. From 2001 to 2017, a majority (60%) of immigrants deported have not been convicted of a crime."  </p>

<p>human trafficking  </p>
<p>"Traffickers prey on victims with little or no social safety<br>
net. They look for victims who are vulnerable because of<br>
their illegal immigration status, limited English<br>
proficiency, and those who may be in vulnerable situations<br>
due to economic hardship, political instability, natural<br>
disasters, or other causes. "<br>

<p>"Many of the migrants fleeing to the U.S. border for protection are women who face physical and psychological abuse at home in countries where the authorities are either unable or unwilling to help them. Others are fleeing the physical and sexual violence of gangs like MS-13 in their native countries."  </p>
