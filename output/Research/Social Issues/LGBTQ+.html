<p>"Cooper’s order forbids funds controlled by executive branch agencies from paying for such therapy for minors. That includes state and federal money for the state’s Medicaid program and NC Health Choice insurance for children in low- and middle-income families."  </p>
<p>"Eighteen states have enacted laws banning or restricting the practice that’s opposed by the American Psychological Association, though none are in the South, according to advocacy groups that track the issue."  </p>

"Cross study investigation reveals that<br>
transgender people, in general, are at<br>
high risk of abuse and violence. Initial<br>
data reported by MAP state that an<br>
average of 42% of transgender people<br>
have experienced some form of<br>
physical violence or abuse. Further, an<br>
average 80% of transgender people<br>
have experienced verbal abuse or<br>
harassment (MAP, 2009). Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that<br>
transgender elders may have experienced some form of abuse"  </p>
