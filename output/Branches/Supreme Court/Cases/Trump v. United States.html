<p>[In reference to Jan 6th]: </p>
<p><em>Argued April 25, 2024—Decided July 1, 2024</em></p>
<h1>Opening</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>A federal grand jury indicted former President Donald J. Trump on four
    counts for conduct that occurred during his Presidency following the
    November 2020 election. The indictment alleged that after losing that
    election, Trump conspired to overturn it by spreading knowingly false
    claims of election fraud to obstruct the collecting, counting, and certi-
    fying of the election results. Trump moved to dismiss the indictment
    based on Presidential immunity, arguing that a President has absolute
    immunity from criminal prosecution for actions performed within the
    outer perimeter of his official responsibilities, and that the indict-
    ment’s allegations fell within the core of his official duties. The District
    Court denied Trump’s motion to dismiss, holding that former Presi-
    dents do not possess federal criminal immunity for any acts. The D. C.
    Circuit affirmed. Both the District Court and the D. C. Circuit de-
    clined to decide whether the indicted conduct involved official acts</p>

<h1>Questions</h1>
<ol>
<li>Was January 6 an official act of president? </li>
</ol>
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Presidential immunity is required for official actions to ensure
    that the President’s decisionmaking is not distorted by the threat of
    future litigation stemming from those actions, that concern does not
    support immunity for unofficial conduct. Clinton, 520 U. S., at 694,
    and n. 19. The separation of powers does not bar a prosecution predi-
    cated on the President’s unofficial acts. P. 15
- presidential immunity is only granted for official acts as president </p>
</blockquote>
<p>An <em>official act</em> seems to be when a president acts pursuant to constitutional and statutory authority </p>
<h2>Act 2</h2>
<p>*pressuring vice president to reject States legitimate electoral votes/send them back to state legislatures for review *</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever the President and Vice President discuss their official re-
    sponsibilities, they engage in official conduct. Presiding over the Jan-
    uary 6 certification proceeding at which Members of Congress count
    the electoral votes is a constitutional and statutory duty of the Vice
    President. Art. II, §1, cl. 3; Amdt. 12; 3 U. S. C. §15</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>essentially immune from conviction here</em></p>
<h2>Court Discussion</h2>
<p>Chief justice roberts delivers opinion of court that according to the indictment, trump advanced his goal through five means
1. he and co-conspirators used knowingly false claims of election fraud to get state legislators and election officials to change electoral votes for Trumps opponent (Joe Biden)
2. Trump + co-conspirators organized fraudulent slates of electors in seven target states and caused these electors to transmit their false certificates to the VP and other officials 
3. Trump and co-conspirators attempted to use the justice department to conduct sham election crime investigates and to send a letter to the targeted states that falsely claimed the JD had identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election 
4. Trump and his co-conspirators attempted to persuade “the Vice President to use his ceremonial role at the January 6 certification proceeding to fraudulently alter the election results. And when that failed, on the morning of January 6, they “repeated knowingly false claims of election fraud to gathered supporters, falsely told them that the Vice President had the authority to and might alter the election results, and ==directed them to the Capitol to obstruct the certification proceeding.”==
5. when “a large and angry crowd . . . violently attacked the Capitol and halted the proceeding,” Trump and his coconspirators “exploited the disruption by redoubling efforts to levy false claims of election fraud and convince Members of Congress to further delay the certification.”</p>
