<p>"I also examined the census results for California, the state with both the greatest number of legal<br>
and illegal immigrants by far—over a quarter of the national total, including the largest<br>
concentrations by far of Mexicans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans, as well as of many other<br>
immigrant groups—and with the greatest number of people in prisons and jails. Overall, nativeborn men 18 to 39 in California have higher incarceration rates than the rest of the United States,<br>
while the foreign-born have lower rates in California compared to the rest of the country. The<br>
incarceration rate for the native-born is more than one percentage point higher in California than<br>
in the rest of the country (4.5% to 3.4%). In contrast, the incarceration rate for the foreign-born<br>
in California was less than half the foreign-born rate in the rest of the country (0.4% to 1.0%). "  </p>
