<h1>Why did Kamala Lose?</h1>
<h2>Campaign Reasoning</h2>
<ul>
<li>she did lose all battleground states however the margins were not far off </li>
<li>not a lengthy campaign</li>
<li>spent more time on culture war or woke issues vs policy / economic issues<ul>
<li>concern over continuation of Biden's presidency </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Immigration concern????</li>
<li>I genuinely think people vote on vibes of the current party <ul>
<li>The reason trump lost 2020 was because of the issues with covid making Americans feel Biden would do better </li>
<li>Kamala has the same issues here despite a recovering economy American's are still feeling the residual effects of the pandemic </li>
<li>Need to find the poll on what made Americans vote </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>a lot of people just did not come out and vote </li>
