## Stance

As [[Abortion]] is a non-divisive issue for the nation, I remain with the position that abortion should be legal at least the first trimesters. 

### Why? 
The important concept of life where we evaluate our experience, processing and general life comes from **consciousness** which does not develop until roughly at least 20 weeks. There is generally no harm in removing a fetus that has no experience. Almost like pulling the plug on someone who is *medically dead* although some people will fight over this.  

What constitutes as [[Personhood]]? 



### "My Body My Choice"

Not a fan of this argument, as I do not believe another experience within the body gives humans the right to terminate them. 

- In the example of conjoined twins where two people are literally attached, would one twin have the right to kill the other? 
	- Let's say you believe *oh well one is not a sane experience* you are either conceding
		- 1. That it's not the bodily autonomy that matters but the experience 
		- 2. No one should be allowed to terminate another experience solely for relying on the same body
- What if a baby depended on you to breastfeed them? *theoretical*
-  Someone alcohol poisons you and destroys your kidney, are they compelled to give you a kidney? 
- Should a pregnant women be able to personally abort her fetus with no repercussions in this case? 



### Viability

Ehh this one is interesting, this would be hard - viability has several different pinpoints and this *could* almost be a eugenics stance
