        <p>Opening doors effect on homelessness  </p>
<p>"homeless of vets decreasing 33% As a nation, we have made great strides since Opening Doors was first released in 2010. Unprecedented collaboration across the Federal government and among states, local communities, advocates, and private and nonprofit partners has resulted in the reduction of homelessness across all populations. Since the adoption of the original plan, homelessness among Veterans has been reduced by 33 percent, including an incredible 43 percent reduction in the number of Veterans and their families living on the streets. The number of individuals experiencing chronic homelessness has fallen by 21 percent. Homelessness among families with children has decreased 15 percent, including a 53 percent reduction in unsheltered homelessness among families, and we have more knowledge about the unique circumstances of homelessness among youth than ever. While our work is not finished, our progress thus far is proving that homelessness is not the intractable problem many once thought it to be, but a problem we can solve."  </p>
<p>"The Affordable Care Act, a landmark achievement of the Obama Administration, furthers the Plan’s goals by helping numerous families and individuals experiencing homelessness get the health care they need. All states now have the opportunity to expand Medicaid eligibility to nearly all individuals under the age of 65 with incomes up to 133 percent of the<br>
Federal poverty level (currently about $15,500 for a single individual). As of May 2015, 30 states including the District of Columbia have acted to expand their Medicaid programs. This significant expansion allows more families and adults without dependent children to enroll<br>
in Medicaid. Medicaid provides for both physical health and behavioral health care including substance use disorder treatment. In addition, the Affordable Care Act includes a number of service delivery demonstrations to improve the quality of health care. For example, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service’s (CMS) Health Care Innovation Awards have provided grant funds to test innovative models of care delivery, including grants specifically focused on people experiencing homelessness. CMS’s State Innovation Model grants are assisting states to experiment with new benefits and payment systems that can improve services for people experiencing homelessness. The Affordable Care Act has also encouraged states to pursue care delivery innovations for high need populations, including people experiencing homelessness through 1115 waivers and the health home state plan option.
