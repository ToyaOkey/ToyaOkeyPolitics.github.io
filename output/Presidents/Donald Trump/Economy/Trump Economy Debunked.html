    1.  quoted that his administration has lifted <strong>10 million</strong> people off of <em>welfare i.e Food Stamps</em>
        1. It is true that food stamps have been declining by millions the figure has been showing to drop since 2013 
        2. It seems that the SNAP figure is closer to <em>5 million</em> compared to 10 million 
        3. <img src="../../../../output/Images/Pasted image 20241130080453.png" alt="Pasted image 20241130080453.png">
        4. Number of Americans on food stamps increase during the recession of 2007 - 2009 and after the enrollment peaked in 2012 the figure has dropped 
        5. Additionally regulations have tightened for able bodied people <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/FNS-2018-0004-19017"><em>Regulations.gov</em></a>
        6. <em>"Last summer, the administration said another proposal could reduce SNAP enrollment by 3 million by limiting state flexibility regarding income and asset levels of recipients."</em><br>
        7.   <em>"The White House Council of Economic Advisers said the drop in Medicaid participation “is predominantly due to a reduction in the number of Medicaid-eligible individuals because of income growth, not eligibility restrictions.”"</em><br>
        8. <em>"But, she said, some who have left Medicaid/CHIP have likely become uninsured, since “survey data also show a recent rise in the uninsured rate, driven by decreases in Medicaid and CHIP coverage.”"</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!summary]
The figure may further decline due to factors beyond the economy, such as administration changes to eligibility, but those haven’t yet gone into effect. A USDA rule for tightened requirements on able-bodied adults without dependents is set to go into effect on April 1 and would reduce SNAP eligibility by 688,000 people next fiscal year, according to the USDA analysis</p>
