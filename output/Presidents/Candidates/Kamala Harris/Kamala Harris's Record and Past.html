        <h1>District Attorney</h1>
<h2>1990 - 2004</h2>
<ul>
<li>Appointed by Terence Hallinan in 1988 to be assistant district attorney <ul>
<li>Became chief of Career Criminal Division, supervising 5 other attorneys prosecutiing homicide, buglary, robbery and SA cases </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>District Attorney of San Francisco (2004–2011)</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
<li>attacked former office with weak conviction rate (%52) compared to a national of 82% and critiqued he did not go hard enough on crimes such as gun violence in poorer neighborhoods + willing to accept plea bargains in cases of Domestic Violence(DV)</li>
<li>expresses support for SF being a sanctuary city status during criminal investigation</li>
<li>supported high bail for gun-related crimes (she later changed her opinion on bail)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Offenses</h3>
<p>Marijuana 
 - Under Harris, the D.A.'s office obtained more than 1,900 convictions for marijuana offenses, including persons simultaneously convicted of marijuana offenses and more serious crimes
 - The rate at which Harris's office prosecuted marijuana crimes was higher than the rate under Hallinan (former D.A), but the number of defendants sentenced to state prison for such offenses was <em>substantially</em> lower
 - low-level marijuana offenses were rare under Harris (only few people were actually locked up for marijuana charges) and her office had a policy of not pursuing jail time for marijuana possession offenses. 
     - most defendants were referred to drug treatment programs instead of being charged 
 - She had lower conviction rates than other prosecutes 
     &gt;  “Kamala Harris and I disagreed on a lot of criminal justice issues, but I have to admit, she was probably the most progressive prosecutor in the state at the time when it came to marijuana,” Solis said
 - Vast majority of marijuana cases in the state are prosecuted by independently elected county districts attorneys 
 - It has been seen she does change her mind on convictions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200610170655/https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/08/01/democratic-debate-kamala-harris-tulsi-gabbard-joe-biden-fact-check/">link</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Her attorneys also defended several other convictions with serious problems. In one case, her office defended a murder conviction in which a prosecutor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200610170655/https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/04/alex-kozinski-and-the-ninth-circuits-crusade-against-prosecutorial-misconduct.html">allowed false testimony</a> in court. That provoked harsh criticism of her office from a federal appeals court panel, and Harris later changed her position, arguing for the conviction to be reversed."
Harris has a mixed record on marijuana. She supported legal medical marijuana from her very first political campaign, but opposed efforts to legalize recreational marijuana in California in 2010 and took no position on the legalization ballot measure that eventually passed in 2016. While launching her attorney general re-election campaign in 2014, Harris <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200610170655/https://www.kcra.com/article/commitment-2014-the-race-for-californias-ag/5955217#!bwTpWN">let out a big laugh</a> when asked by a local TV reporter about her opponent’s support of legalizing pot for recreational use.
  - While this is true this shows GREAT work in our election system, politicians SHOULD change their beliefs and actions to raise a voter base, the fact that she is pushing for marijuana changes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200517222755/https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/23/kamala-harris-bill-marijuana-decriminalize-cannabis-industry/">now</a> as she was pushed by voters is an AMAZING thing </p>
